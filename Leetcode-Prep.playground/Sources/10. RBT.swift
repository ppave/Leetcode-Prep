// A red-black tree (RBT) is a balanced version of a Binary Search Tree

// Red Black Trees provide faster insertion and removal operations than AVL trees
// as fewer rotations are done due to relatively relaxed balancing.
// AVL trees provide complex insertion and removal operations as more rotations are done due to relatively strict balancing
